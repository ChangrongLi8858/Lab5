1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.                            
   No              
   It is a complex workflow involving multiple components, which makes it more suitable for         integration or end-to-end testing.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.                            
   yes                                           
   It is a small, logic-driven feature that is well-suited for unit testing to verify its behavior.
