1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.                            
   **No**              
- It is a complex workflow involving multiple components, which makes it more suitable for integration or end-to-end testing. As unit tests focus on isolated functions, not system wide behavior.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.            
   **Yes**                                           
- It is a small, logic-driven feature that is well-suited for unit testing to verify its behavior. It's a single, well defined rule, and easy to test in isolation with simple inputs. Which is also fast, reliable checks for edge cases.
