1. IDs & Classes are nametags that help to organize the website when it comes to technology intersections. IDs are unique such as our student ID, while classes can be reused such as grouping students in the "CSE110" class. Good label usage would make it easier for CSS to style things and JavaScript to find them.
2. Data attributes permit us to add extra information to HTML elements. They start with `data-` and use such as in `<div data-user="7"></div>`. These are useful since it would keep the data out of our CSS and JavaScript code, could add any information when we needed to, and we can read them easily in JavaScript with something like `element.dataset.user` or `element.getAttribute('data-user')`. Data attributes are just for our own code, it does not tell search engines or screen readers anything special. But if we want and need to share real information, the use of official HTML microdata tags would come in handy.
3. When we create a mini document in memory, it would be a DOM fragment. The page will not lag if we add a lot of items to it. When we are ready, we attach the whole fragment to the page at once. The browser simply redraws the page once, making this technique quick and powerful.
4. A virtual DOM is a copy of our page structure kept in memory as JavaScript objects. Frameworks like React use it to decide what actual changes the page needs when our data changes. We would write how the page should look, and the library figures out the smallest real updates. This makes our code simpler and often faster for big updates. The lose is that there is extra work keeping the two copies of real and virtual, which can use more memory and CPU.
5. This is because the word `class` is reserved in JavaScript as it is being used to define for classes of the templates for objects. And to avoid such conflict, we would use something like `element.className` in JavaScript for the HTML `class` attribute. Such permits us to read or set the CSS classes on an element without using a JavaScript keyword.
6. With `addEventListener()` is like sending many invites to one party, it lets us to have multiple actions per click, and it is better for big projects. While on the other hand `onClick()` is like sending just one invite, is simpler but only allows one action, and it mixes HTML and JavaScript together.
